    <p>Riley was adopted from  <a href="https://www.charmingpetrescue.org/">Charming Pet Rescue</a> in Boerne, Texas. For this reason, she has a special jingle written about her: "She's the bestest in the Westest, 'cause this girly is from Texas!" </p>

    <p>Goose hails from North Carolina. He loves to fetch, swim, and steal licks of whatever his parents are eating.</p>
